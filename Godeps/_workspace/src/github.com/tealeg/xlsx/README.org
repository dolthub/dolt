* XSLX
** Introduction
xlsx is a library to simplify reading and writing the XML format used
by recent version of Microsoft Excel in Go programs.

The support for writing XLSX files is currently extremely minimal.  It
will expand slowly, but in the meantime patches are welcome!

** Full API docs
The full API docs can be viewed using go's built in documentation
tool, or online at [[http://godoc.org/github.com/tealeg/xlsx][godoc.org]].

** Basic Usage
*** Reading XLSX files
Here is a minimal example usage that will dump all cell data in a
given XLSX file.  A more complete example of this kind of
functionality is contained in [[https://github.com/tealeg/xlsx2csv][the XLSX2CSV program]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/tealeg/xlsx"
)

func main() {
    excelFileName := "/home/tealeg/foo.xlsx"
    xlFile, err := xlsx.OpenFile(excelFileName)
    if err != nil {
        ...
    }
    for _, sheet := range xlFile.Sheets {
        for _, row := range sheet.Rows {
            for _, cell := range row.Cells {
                fmt.Printf("%s\n", cell.String())
            }
        }
    }
}

#+END_SRC

Some additional information is available from the cell (for example,
style information).  For more details see the godoc output for this
package.

*** Writing XLSX files
The following constitutes the bare minimum required to write an XLSX document.

#+BEGIN_SRC go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/tealeg/xlsx"
)

func main() {
    var file *xlsx.File
    var sheet *xlsx.Sheet
    var row *xlsx.Row
    var cell *xlsx.Cell
    var err error

    file = xlsx.NewFile()
    sheet, err = file.AddSheet("Sheet1")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf(err.Error())
    }
    row = sheet.AddRow()
    cell = row.AddCell()
    cell.Value = "I am a cell!"
    err = file.Save("MyXLSXFile.xlsx")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf(err.Error())
    }
}
