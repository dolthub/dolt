# Welcome

*Noms* is a decentralized database philosophically descendant from the Git version control system.

Like Git, Noms is:

* **Versioned:** By default, all previous versions of the database are retained. You can trivially track how the database evolved to its current state, easily and efficiently compare any two versions, or even rewind and branch from any previous version.
* **Synchronizable:** Instances of a single Noms database can be disconnected from each other for any amount of time, then later reconcile their changes efficiently and correctly.

Unlike Git, Noms is a database, so it also:

* Primarily **stores structured data**, not files and directories (see: [the Noms type system](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/doc/intro.md#types))
* **Scales well** to large amounts of data and concurrent clients
* Supports **atomic transactions** (a single instance of Noms is CP, but Noms is typically run in production backed by S3, in which case it is "[effectively CA](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/whitepapers/SpannerAndCap.pdf)")
* Supports **efficient indexes** (see: [Noms prolly-trees](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/doc/intro.md#prolly-trees-probabilistic-b-trees))
* Features a **flexible query model** (see: [GraphQL](./go/ngql/README.md))

A Noms database can reside within a file system or in the cloud:

* The (built-in) [NBS](./go/nbs) `ChunkStore` implementation provides two back-ends which provide persistence for Noms databases: one for storage in a file system and one for storage in an S3 bucket.

Finally, because Noms is content-addressed, it yields a very pleasant programming model.

Working with Noms is ***declarative***. You don't `INSERT` new data, `UPDATE` existing data, or `DELETE` old data. You simply *declare* what the data ought to be right now. If you commit the same data twice, it will be deduplicated because of content-addressing. If you commit _almost_ the same data, only the part that is different will be written.

<br>

## Use Cases

#### [Decentralization](./doc/decent/about.md)

Because Noms is very good at sync, it makes a decent basis for rich, collaborative, fully-decentralized applications.

#### ClientDB (coming someday)

Embed Noms into mobile applications, making it easier to build offline-first, fully synchronizing mobile applications.

## Setup

```shell
# You probably want to add this to your environment
export NOMS_VERSION_NEXT=1

go get github.com/attic-labs/noms/cmd/noms
go install github.com/attic-labs/noms/cmd/noms
```

<br>

## Run

Import some data:

```shell
go install github.com/attic-labs/noms/samples/go/csv/csv-import
curl 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/kku6-nxdu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD' > /tmp/data.csv
csv-import /tmp/data.csv /tmp/noms::nycdemo
```

Explore:

```shell
noms show /tmp/noms::nycdemo
```

Should show:

```go
struct Commit {
  meta: struct Meta {
    date: "2017-09-19T19:33:01Z",
    inputFile: "/tmp/data.csv",
  },
  parents: set {},
  value: [  // 236 items
    struct Row {
      countAmericanIndian: "0",
      countAsianNonHispanic: "3",
      countBlackNonHispanic: "21",
      countCitizenStatusTotal: "44",
      countCitizenStatusUnknown: "0",
      countEthnicityTotal: "44",
...
```

## Status

### Data Format

We are fairly confident in the core data format, and plan to support Noms database [version `7`](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/v7/go/constants/version.go#L9) and forward. If you create a database with Noms today, future versions will have migration tools to pull your databases forward.

### Roadmap

We plan to implement the following for Noms version 8:
 - [x] Horizontal scalability (Done! See: [nbs](./go/nbs/README.md))
 - [x] Automatic merge (Done! See: [CommitOptions.Policy](https://godoc.org/github.com/attic-labs/noms/go/datas#CommitOptions) and the `noms merge` subcommand).
 - [x] Query language (Done! See [ngql](./go/ngql/README.md))
 - [ ] Garbage Collection (https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/3374)
 - [x] Optional fields (https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2327)
 - [ ] Implement migration (https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/3363)
 - [ ] Fix sync performance with long commit chains (https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2233)
 - [ ] [Various other smaller bugs and improvements](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AP0)
