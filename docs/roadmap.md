# Dolt feature roadmap

Full details on [supported SQL
features](https://docs.dolthub.com/interfaces/sql/sql-support) are
available on the docs site.

This is a selection of unimplemented features we're working on. It's
not an ordered list. Don't see what you need on here? [Let us
know!](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues) Paying customers get
their feature requests implemented first.
