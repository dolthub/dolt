// separate go-routine and should run and provide the functionality associated
// with the service until the |Stop| function is called.

// ServiceState is a small abstraction so that a service implementation can

// the service is only init'd or if it is running. It's also not rare for a
// service to decide it needs to do nothing in Init, in which case it can leave
// the service in Off, and the Run and Close methods can check that to ensure
// they do not do anything either.

// A Controller is responsible for initializing a number of registered
// services, running them all, and stopping them all when requested. Services
// are registered with |Register(Service)|. When |Start| is called, the
// services are all initialized, in the order of their registration, and if
// every service initializes successfully, they are |Run| concurrently. When
// |Stop| is called, services are stopped in reverse-registration order. |Stop|
// returns once the corresponding |Stop| method on all successfully |Init|ed
// services has returned. |Stop| does not explicitly block for the goroutines
// where the |Run| methods are called to complete.  Typically a Service's
// |Stop| function should ensure that the |Run| method has completed before
// returning.
//
// Any attempt to register a service after |Start| or |Stop| has been called
// will return an error.
//
// If an error occurs when initializing the services of a Controller, the
// Stop functions of any already initialized Services are called in
// reverse-order. The error which caused the initialization error is returned.
//
// In the case that all Services Init successfully, the error returned from
// |Start| is the first non-nil error which is returned from the |Stop|
// functions, in the order they are called.
//
// If |Stop| is called before |Start|, |Start| will return an error. |Register|
// will also begin returning an error after |Stop| is called, if it is called
// before |Start|.
//
// |WaitForStart| can be called at any time on a Controller. It will block
// until |Start| is called. After |Start| is called, if all the services
// succesfully initialize, it will return |nil|. Otherwise it will return the
// same error |Start| returned.
//
// |WaitForStop| can be called at any time on a Controller. It will block until
// |Start| is called and initialization fails, or until |Stop| is called.  It
// will return the same error which |Start| returned.
