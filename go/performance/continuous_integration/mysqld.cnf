# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

# The following values assume you have at least 32M ram

# * Basic Settings

# changed. Ref https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_tmpdir
# tmpdir		= /tmp
#
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.

# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
#
# Log all queries
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
