// A ChunkStore's |ExclusiveAccessMode| can indicate to a client what type of
// exclusive access and concurrency control are support by the ChunkStore, and
// for a ChunkStore instance which the client is holding, what level of access
// it has. Typically, a ChunkStore will be in Mode_Shared, which means multiple
// processes can concurrently write to the chunk store and the chunk store can
// change out from under the process. Other possible modes, currently only used
// by local ChunkStores using the chunk journal in go/store/nbs are
// Mode_ReadOnly, which means the journal was opened in read only mode and all
// attempts to write will fail, or Mode_Exclusive, which means the journal was
// opened successfully in write mode and no other processes will write to it
// while this ChunkStore is open.
