Package datas includes interfaces bridging database transactions and versioned
commit graph logic.

Datas includes logic for manipulating a versioned database through a backing
chunks.ChunkStore. In the old storage format, that was the NomsBlockStore. In
the new storage format, this is the NodeStore.
