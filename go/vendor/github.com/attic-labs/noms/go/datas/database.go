// Database provides versioned storage for noms values. While Values can be
// directly read and written from a Database, it is generally more appropriate
// to read data by inspecting the Head of a Dataset and write new data by
// updating the Head of a Dataset via Commit() or similar. Particularly, new
// data is not guaranteed to be persistent until after a Commit (Delete,
// SetHead, or FastForward) operation completes.
// The Database API is stateful, meaning that calls to GetDataset() or
// Datasets() occurring after a call to Commit() (et al) will represent the
// result of the Commit().
