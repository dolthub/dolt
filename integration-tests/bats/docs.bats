# Dolt is Git for Data!

Dolt is a SQL database that you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push
and pull just like a git repository. Connect to Dolt just like any
MySQL database to run queries or update the data using SQL
commands. Use the command line interface to import CSV files, commit
your changes, push them to a remote, or merge your teammate's changes.

All the commands you know for Git work exactly the same for Dolt. Git
versions files, Dolt versions tables. It's like Git and MySQL had a
baby.

We also built [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com), a place to share
Dolt databases. We host public data for free. If you want to host
your own version of DoltHub, we have [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com). If you want us to run a Dolt server for you, we have [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com).
