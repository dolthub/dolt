# Mikro-ORM Smoke Test

The `index.ts` file is the main entry point and will insert a new record into the database, then load it, print
success, and exit with a zero exit code. If any errors are encountered, they are logged, and the process exits with a
non-zero exit code.

To run this smoke test project:
1. Run `npm install` command
2. Run `npm start` command
