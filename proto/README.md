Protobuf message and service definitions.

The Go bindings are generated by developers and placed in ../go/gen/.

After modifying a .proto file, run: `bazel run //:update` from the `proto/` subdirectory.

The //:update target also updates ../go/gen/fb/serial message implementations. Somewhat awkwardly, for the time being, the source for those lives in ../go/serial.
