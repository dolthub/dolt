Use "cbt help <command>" for more information about a command.

The options are:

	-project string
		project ID, if unset uses gcloud configured project
	-instance string
		Cloud Bigtable instance
	-creds string
		if set, use application credentials in this file


Alpha features are not currently available to most Cloud Bigtable customers. The
features might be changed in backward-incompatible ways and are not recommended
for production use. They are not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.

For convenience, values of the -project, -instance, -creds,
-admin-endpoint and -data-endpoint flags may be specified in
~/.cbtrc in this format:

	project = my-project-123
	instance = my-instance
	creds = path-to-account-key.json
	admin-endpoint = hostname:port
	data-endpoint = hostname:port

All values are optional, and all will be overridden by flags.
