# A document can have more than one ServerTimestamp field. Since all the
# ServerTimestamp fields are removed, the only field in the update is "a".

# b is not in the mask because it will be set in the transform. c must be in the
# mask: it should be replaced entirely. The transform will set c.d to the
# timestamp, but the update will delete the rest of c.
