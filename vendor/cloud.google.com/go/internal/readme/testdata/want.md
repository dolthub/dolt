This template is for testing snipmd.awk.

Put the first snippet here.

[snip]:# (first)
```go
fmt.Println("hello")
x := ...
```

And now the second.
[snip]:# (second)
```go
if x > 2 {
	...
}
```

A top-level snippet.

[snip]:# (top-level)
```go
var ErrBad = errors.New("bad")
```

```go
// A code block that is not included.
```

And we're done.
