This directory contains auto-generated mocks for the ProfilerService interface.

To regenerate the mocks, install https://github.com/golang/mock tool and run
the command below while in the `mocks` directory.

```
mockgen -package mocks google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/devtools/cloudprofiler/v2 \
         ProfilerServiceClient \
         > mock_profiler_client.go
```

Then re-add the copyright header in the file. You also need to either run the
commands above using Golang 1.6 or manually change the "context" import to
"golang.org/x/net/context" to ensure the compatibility with Go 1.6.
